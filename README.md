# AI-Based Book Recommendation System

This project is an AI-based recommendation system that uses the Best-First Search algorithm to suggest books based on user preferences. It includes a Java Swing GUI for user interaction and uses a sample dataset of books.

## Project Structure

- `phase2codeWithGUI.java`: The main Java file containing the implementation of the recommendation system and the GUI.
- `Book Sample.txt`: A sample dataset of books used by the recommendation system.
- `README.md`: This file.


## Dataset

The dataset (`Book Sample.txt`) contains a list of books with the following format:
Title,Author,Genre,Rating


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the Java program:**

    ```bash
    javac phase2codeWithGUI.java
    ```

2. **Run the program:**

    ```bash
    java phase2codeWithGUI
    ```

    - The program will launch a GUI where you can enter your genre preference.
    - Based on your input, the system will recommend books.
